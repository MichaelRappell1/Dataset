Take goodbye and never look back again

Looking at your watch a third time
Waiting in the station for the bus
Going to a place that's far
So far away and if that's not enough
Going where nobody says hello
They don't talk to anybody they don't know

You'll wind up in some factory
That's full-time filth and nowhere left to go
Walk home to an empty house
Sit around all by yourself
I know it might sound strange but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville

At night, I drink myself to sleep
And pretend I don't care that you're not here with me

All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong


Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

1340,"We listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there
Not like you

Ignorant siblings at the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy
Spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see
But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?
And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
Your way home

Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?
High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
You're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates, saying
""I have come home now
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
It's time now, my time now
Give me my, give me my wings""

Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my wings
You are the light and way that they will only read about

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence
Judith Marie, unconditional one

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion
Should you see your maker's face tonight
Look him in the eye, look him in the eye, and tell him
""I never lived a lie, never took a life, but surely saved one
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home.""","10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)",TOOL,Antagonistic,1.67443422925249,2006-04-28,123,63,26,-9,4,11:14,1,57,1349,4754,-3.25,-23.09,-2.63,-11.64,-37.88,3.86,-29.43,-23.45,4.03,-29.31,-37.6,11.13,-18.3860911270983,-35.1654676258993,-12.9893992932862,-67.5759717314488,10.5661605206074,-31.3817787418655,12.4938271604938,-51.3148148148148,1995,990,1000,990,0.4962406015037593,1,0.3971202011832931,0.0898301517005596

Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet

Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth
Below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it, to see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth

Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look

I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, ""True, though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a ""Respectfully,"" I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' ""Bro,"" but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la


After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

There's no earthly way of knowing
What was in your heart
When it stopped going
The whole world shook
A storm was blowing through you
Waiting for God to stop this
And up to your neck in darkness
Everyone around you was corrupted
Saying something

There's no dignity in death
To sell the world your last breath
We're still fighting over
Everything you left

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

Through your eyes the world was burning
Please be gentle, I'm still learning
You seemed to say as you kept turning up
They poisoned you with compromise
At what point did you realize
Everybody loves your life but you

A special agent for the man
Through Watergate and Vietnam
No one really gave a damn
Did you think the CIA did

Africa is my descent
And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that's meant
Meant for many men not my tone
The blood of God is my defence
Let it drip down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat
From kings and queens becomes a prince
Knowledge and wisdom is understanding what we need

And this game of love
Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own
And this game of love
Everyday I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive, I receive the love

In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks

He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another

To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes

A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masses
To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits
We're still here runnin' 'round screamin', they're still here pointin' and laughin'
Don't walk away when I talk, I'm tellin' you ""turn around, mister.""
I got a permanent bop, who the hell do I think I am not?
And I'm twice as hot as about half of hell
I get lighthouse lit up, get down, Diduck
The boy got a barracuda bite, you can tell

Got hope for the livin', got prayers for the dead
In the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain 'cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust
Somewhere between love and lust, a nut get bust and a baby get made
It seems that trouble trouble us and follow us like all our days
In every holy book it says we suffer, that's what it is
So riddle me this; from the womb to the tomb, why do we fight to live?

A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masses
To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits
We're still here runnin' 'round screamin', they're still here pointin' and laughin'
Got hope for the livin', got prayers for the dead
In the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain, the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust

You say you wanna be my leader, I think you wanna be my God
You say you on the side of the righteous (Right) I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong
There's truth where the filth is, there's lies in the law
You want a whore with a white dress, I want a wife in a thong
You love fear and division (Don't you?) I don't fuck with your symbolism
I don't give a fuck about power, I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid
Cut an ear from a mouse hat, go Van Gogh on a house rat
Find another mind to devour, motherfucker, I'm really not hearin' it

A pope is a fraud, a church is a lie
A queen is the same damn thing, you should pray to your fake god that she die
God really exists? I'll tell you, like this: it reside inside
And anybody tell you different just sellin' you religion tryna keep your ass in line
I kill my masters, I mentor none
That means when I die, that's it, my style is gone; I'm a one of one
One half of the great RTJ
Defeated the odds, went to war with the gods
Earned all our scars and came back straight (RTJ)

A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masses
To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit

Behold the animals and the birds and the sky entire

A prayer to the air, to the air that we breathe

4,"It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

Now the light fades out
And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought I remembered you

So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals and S.U's
And things that I just don't understand
Like a white lie at night
Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway
""Please sit down.""
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed
You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no one to love

So I found out your reasons for the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts and I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
So it's time to leave
You see, it meant everything to me",Are 'Friends' Electric?,Gary Numan,Dionysitic,1.69204969539255,2008-02-24,94,75,42,-10,43,5:25,3,46,22,4371,-1.25,-7.09,-31.63,-9.64,-21.88,-25.14,-27.43,-7.45,-24.97,-27.31,-21.6,-17.87,-6.38609112709833,3.83453237410072,-0.989399293286226,-28.5759717314488,22.5661605206074,7.61822125813449,24.4938271604938,-12.3148148148148,908,515,538,515,0.5671806167400881,1,0.2539906385633894,0.0923203122035391

Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal

So run
Run, right back to school
Check it

Look back, I sift through all the cliques
Roaming' the halls all year, making me sick
While everyone's out trying to make the cut (What)
And when you think you know me right, I switch it up
Behind the walls, smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
I hop a fence to catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
Give me a break about some other mess
What were you? Act like it's everything you got

Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all, so

Stop that quit, all that quit
Who ruined it? You did, now grab a notebook and a pen
Start taking notes on me and everyone who's on the top
You think we're on the same page, but I know we're not
I'll be the man, watch your backpacks, pens, and pencils
Just like Keith, I'm flippin' it, while you just keep it simple
You just can't go on rocking the clothes
Coppin' the stance, 'cause really it's everything that you're not

Push back the square

You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say, ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says, ""Well, what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""

But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, ""How does it feel to
Be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone

And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""

And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""Now""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back ""You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home""
And you know something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

'Cause something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is

Hey man is there something wrong?
Where has everybody gone?
I don't know
Well I put a rag across my mouth
And I went out
Yeah moving slow
What are you doing he said to me
I'm looking for my company
He said don't bother no

Well, Next thing you know when I took a look
Gabe was trying to sell me a book
But I got no dough
He said ""Check it out It's going cheap
Check it out it's going cheap""
""Ok I'll give it a go""
Well, I read that book - every page
And then I put it away
Said ""I don't think so
It makes slaves of all of womankind
And corpses of the men
And I, I just don't know""
And we care a little bit
We get scared a little bit
Of those two cold dead eyes
That stare a little bit
And we cry a little bit
And we get by a little bit
Yeah, let your tears
All come falling down

Put me on a big white steed
Ride it up and down your street
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
Wrapped in a crimson coat
Sail me in a great big boat
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
I'll sail around the waters for you
Kill your sons and daughters for you
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
Put me on a big white horse
Send me down to Banbury Cross
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
Oh yeah
(Will the soul survive?)
It's okay Joe, its time to go

As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Was his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues

See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes moaning
Hear that undertaker's bell

With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There's a chain gang on the highway

Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it""
She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life""
*Gunshot*

Nothing seems to kill me
No matter how hard I try
Nothing is closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight
No

And nothing seems to break me
No matter how far I fall
Nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up, though not invincible
I know

I've given everything I need, I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to Hell and gone
Burrow down in and

Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world

Someone tried to tell me something
""Don't let the world bring you down""
Nothing can do me in before I do myself
Save it for your own and the ones you can help
No

I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone

Leave, but don't leave me

Ah
Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool, babies – strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

Hold tight, wait till the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire, ah!

All wet, here, you might need a raincoat
Shake-down, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect?”
Gonna burst into flame, ah

Burning down the house

My house is out of the ordinary
That’s right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing, yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire, ah

Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza
We fear no man and throw jams
That attack counterintelligence programs
Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan (hah!)
I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians
Now what the hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us
I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to Zealots

As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
(Should've known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Never without your love

Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Down the street you can hear her scream ""You're a disgrace""
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries ""Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle
But something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually

There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
'Cause she was crippled for life and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, ""You won't hurt me no more""
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee

And many, many, many more to take

From a bitter-sweet ain,
Have you ever kissed the sunshine,
Walked between the rain.
Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.
Well, there was a girl named Christmas,
Did I tell ya she drank gold,
She wasn't very hard to capture,
But she was rather hard to hold.
Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.
Have you ever been in darkness,
And your mind could find no peace,
When you woke up after midnight,
Found your swans had turned to geese.
Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die

And either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns, I will be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there

First of all, let's talk about these ill capers
And fly-ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors
Niggas run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up
'Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
But then The Bible never saved shit
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
You wanna slang crack, or hold TEC’s, and do the concept
You can't make loot when your moms is smokin' up the product
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
The way niggas be gettin' clapped, the shit'll fuckin' scare ya!
But in the dark, we ran wild, son, we killin' em
Niggas scared, can't stand still like fuckin' helium
Fake niggas, they don't go platinum, they go aluminum
Got 'em cloned the fuck up, son, that's why we losin' 'em

To make a big play, but then, it might be a mistake
'Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to D.E

For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats
The snake will be that bitch, and that rat will be that cool cat
With swollen pockets, we gonna take you back home
Master-Allah-Rule-Savior, never clone

Yo, I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date, put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace from a place
Called wild Illadel' Val' Pennsy — that's the residency
Consistent currency, my pocket's never empty
Some cats believe they emcee, but we know they all fraud!
Do a show in Philly, niggas wouldn't applaud
Nobody know your record, nor who you openin' for
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door
So you should prepare for lyrical terror that's pure

Messiah or the kaya lord, down with Dice Raw

Stompin' whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur

You insist to imitate, what for!?
Superstar niggas is 10% real
90% invented for a fuckin' record deal
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next man's skill
But still, I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello
But know the tactics of the P.L.O
These C-L-O-N-E-S fess
The phoniest cats is felonious, word!
Dice Raw, the juvenile lyricist, corner-store terrorist
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique
Leave a nigga shook, to the point he won't speak
Never half-assed, always live and direct
On bitches try to punk, smell the panty and raw sex
Mad lights I had to black out when fake niggas act out
Or step outta place, they get slapped in they face
All y'all niggas is fake, tryin' to emulate my style
What grown man? In this game, to me, you're a child
I trained wack MC's in camps like ex-Marines
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
Of horrifyin' things that your ass never seen before?
You traveled through the realm of Dice Raw
Where clones get they domes blown with chrome microphones
It's not your fault, black, just the fact you wasn't shown
Don't come through this like a smurf
Unnatural, it’s not from this earth
Represent, while I been like this since birth
And I won't be the last, but I definitely was the first!
Dice Raw, big car Logan Val' sol-dier

Don't come across that line, or pay a cost
Knuckle games and hammer cocked, ain't nothin' sweet or soft
Win, lose or draw, to the jaw take one
Deranged lyrical launcher on station
No conversation is needed, my task completed
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis, you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap when I attacked your glamorous
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the right fowl
My character a product of this 2-1-5th trife style!
I breeze through areas niggas would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style is of a Vulcan
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cat, you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggas

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?

Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

But what I'm doing is not a good look
I never did it by the good book as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me

But still something got a hold on me, maybe it's fate

They act like I'm something to fear, trapped in urban warfare
Putting triggers 'head a college career

Down with the shame, down with the shame
Used to walk traps in the rain with cocaine
Used to write raps in the traps as I sat in the rain and I prayed that God give me a lane
Give me a lane, give me the fame
Give me the fame and I promise to change
Won't be the same
Won't be the same kind of man that puts cocaine in this lady hand
Heard she was pregnant, I'm guilty I reckon 'cause I hear that this shit can hurt baby's brain
Heard he was normal 'til three and then he stopped talkin'
Since then, ain't nothin' been the same
Seen her some years later out in Decatur, told her that I'm sorry for causin' her pain
""Causin' me pain? Causin' me pain?""
She asked again and she grabbed my right hand
Asked am I crazy, said ""Look here, baby, I release you from all of your sins and your shame
'Cause I’ve been redeemed, I found in Christ
Whatever it take I hope you find it, Mike.""
The look on her face shown that glory replaced all the shame and the hate and now she wear a crown
My late Grandma Bettie had prayed with her heavy and told her to tell me lay my burdens down

Can't pick up no crown
Holdin' what's holdin' you down
Can't pick up no crown
Holdin' what's holdin' you down
Can't pick up no crown, can't pick up no crown

Down with the shame, down with the shame
Carried the flag in some other man's name
Loaded my weapon and swore to them vengeance and stepped with aggression right into the fray
Into the haze, into the murk
Told me to prove to them what I was worth
We'll teach you to move without mercy and give you the tools to go after the causers of hurt
You'll become death, you will take breath
This is for everything you've ever loved
Use all the pain that you've felt in your life as the currency, go out and trade it for blood
You are not you, you are now us
We are the only ones that you can trust
You'll become fear, they'll become dust
Before this moment, you didn't mean much
You are the smoldering vessel of punishment born to do nothing but justify us
Give us your empathy, we'll give you lust
Let yourself go, my son, time to grow up
Give up your childish obsession with questioning
Anything we don't tell you is irrelevant
Everything you've ever been is replaced by the metal and fire of the weapon you clutch

And during the few moments that we have left
We wanna talk right down to earth
In a language that everybody here can easily understand
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you wanna be
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free


I sell the things you need to be
I'm the smiling face of your TV
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
I exploit you, still you love me
I tell you one and one makes three
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality

He won't have to follow me

You gave me power in your God's name

Blinds wide open like a whore
Paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs

And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself

Radio's on, and I'm moving 'round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire without a spark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, ""You gotta stay hungry""
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart

You can't start a fire

A disappointment condition, a perfunctory prescription
Of an indigent mindset of belligerent silence
We got all we need droning out of a tin can
Thinking about the rain under the sweatshirt hood
Listen to the noise on the battery tape deck
A Judas train wreck, anonymous suspect
Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations
Loners waste away inside of vacant locations
Think tanks empty, international dream bank
Plug in my reactor to the fallout zone
The enemies' story is a lot like mine
And if you get to the point then you know better than I

Dark star, like an eye that's closing
Sees through the shards from a scar that's open

Autopilot drivers riding out on the ice age
Infidels swallowed in a vanishing point
Ammunition souls shooting holes in the ozone
Widow's tears washing the soldier's bones
Sterilized egos, delirium sequels
Punctured by the arrows of American eagles
Robot to teach you all the rules that delete you
Backspace my brain, my equilibrium goes

You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are far too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that, yet you don't want me back

Falling down to go far from the sun

They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad, they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
""You Belong to Me, I Believe""
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave""

And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
""Have mercy on his soul""
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
""Get outta here if you don't know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row""

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
""Which side are you on?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke?

And give them all another name

And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate

And it's all downhill with a bullet
This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course
I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces
Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit
The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

There's a man in the theatre with girlish eyes
Who's holding my childhood to ransom
On the screen there's a death
There's a rustle of cloth
And a sickly voice calling me handsome
There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes
On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla
There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla
This is a secret, mauled and mangled
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood
The lights go down, the red curtains come apart
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart
And the coins in my pocket jingle-jangle
As the great screen crackled and popped
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped
And my handsome little body oddly propped
And my trousers right down to my ankles
Yes, onward! And upward!
And I'm off to find love
Do you love me? If you do, I'm thankful

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

This city is an ogre squatting by the river
It gives life but it takes it away, my youth
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver
This is a fact. This is a stone cold truth
Do you love me? I love you, handsome
But do you love me? Yes, I love you, you are handsome
Amongst the cogs and the wires, my youth
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth
Memories that become monstrous lies
So onward! And Onward! And Onward I go!
Onward! And Upward! And I'm off to find love

Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I’d love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the various sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Like I love you
She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside hеr
I still seemed obsolete
I found god and all his dеvils inside her
In my bed she casts the blizzard out
A mock sin blazed ion her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Like I love you
He had a heart full of love and devotion
She had a mindful of Tyranny and terror
Well I try I do I really try
But I just err baby I do I error
So come find me my darling one
I’m down to the grounds the very Dregs
Ah here she comes blocking the sun
Blood running down the side of her leg
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle jangle
Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? Like I love you
All the things move toward their end
I knew before I met her taht I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I swear I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles

We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted

Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waitin' in the wings ready to D
Thirsty sheists who need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick-up kids, they be out to tax
Most times, they be stickin' you without the gats

Pain beyond measure, relaxed under pressure

Keep em playing they position
Keep making the people listen what I spin

They all standing close to the edge, so don't stress em
Now who the type built to last?

You and me
We used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though
You're letting go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening

She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote

And I say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at 26?
I got the fever for the flavour
Know the payback will be later
Still I need a fix

And the girls on the bus kept laughing at us
As we rode on the 10 down to Venice again
Blaring out the g-funk sipping on juice and gin
Just me and a friend feeling kind of groovy workin' on a movie (yeah
Right)

But we did nothing, absolutely bupkis that day
And I say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at 26?
(With my mind on my money and my money on my BEER!)
I know that life is for the taking
So I better wise up and take it quick (one more time at Trader Vic's)

Where some men there wanted to hurt us
And other men said we weren't worth the fuss
You could catch 'em all bitching by the bar
About the fine line between the rich and the poor
Then Mike turned to me and said ""what you think we get done son?""

We found the conclusion and I guess that's something... right?

Why, why, why, why?

Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man I don't control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “Why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “You got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
'cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “Shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
'cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

Get out, get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way

It be feelin' like the life that I’m living man, I don’t control
'cause every day I’m in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o’s so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn’t record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again early
Get out, get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out, get out

If I changed anything, I mean anything

When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

If I had everything, everything

If I changed anything, I mean anything

From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, ""Screw that bus!"" – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah
Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Baccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll live, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all

You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you

I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up? You see how I played a big
Role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam

People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?

Where I was born, nothing is promised
My life is filled with less hope than the prophecies of Nostradamus
Omega marks the ending of predictability
Birth of agility
Who will it be to test me and expose their futility?
Iron like a lion from Zion, stop tryin' so hard
I think I smell your brain cells fryin'
The family's behind you if you're worthy
Philosophies developed deep in the back streets of dirty Jersey
Troops with skully hats and Timberland boots
No more breakdancing for loot, niggas hustle and shoot
In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals
Government funds are minimal, oppression's subliminal (Yo)

These days it's hard for we to find peace of mind
Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line
Some dwell in hotels with jezebels
A stone age and fall a victim to the plague
Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend
One last kiss from my sweet serpentine
Eliminate, break, navigate
To rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconcil'ation came from my enemy-friend
Who said, ""Family don't bend, we stay solid 'til the end""
Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend?
Stare into the air, inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts that ain't even here
Like Alex Haley, take notes on his biography
My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang like my chitty bang-bang
Shebang for the head, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign, okay

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaitan don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaitan don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray (Nah, fuck that)

Yo, fifty-two pick-ups, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody, one false move, you'll find her body in the sea (Don't move, don't move)
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies, I'm far from a jive turkey

My circle, it can't be broken open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin', tokin', chokin' on they words like smokin'
'Cause we soft-spoken doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your booty smell rotten and one day you will be gotten
See, jokers is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
'Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats, I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See, poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I seen the biggest niggas on the blocks get murdered, and they deserved it
Or so the beast said when they served it, that shit is nervous
So what's my purpose? Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired, I hope you like the hell fires

Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaitan don't play
So the family stick together and we never betray, yeah

We used to jump rope, but now we gun hold
Bustin' shots off of project rooftops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ahk, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships, imagine full Glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin, gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the lightweights for thinkin' they important
The night pays in heavenly ways, ain't nothin' free
I ask knowledge in your family and step into your B.I. 
You see I stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when we got beef then jet down to South Beach
Your mouthpiece is yappin', I hear it in your rappin'

From the dusty mesa
Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches
Of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood
In the hushing dusk, under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
A strange hunger haunted me, the looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush and felt a trembling hand

When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones

Immunity, long overdue

Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity""

Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity

Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you
My own mitosis
Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, you spectacle
Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady
Exorcise the disparate
Poison for eternity
Purge me and evacuate
The venom and the fear that binds me

Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

I commence to moving

One in the clouds

Push myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
On and on and on and on and...

Me and my gang come to bust you loose

Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here, they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
And then came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then... nothing

Oh, little town in the USA, your time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?

I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""

But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free

But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep

Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew

Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up

Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none

'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off

With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?

My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking scabs again
I'm down, digging through
My old muscles, looking for a clue

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I wanna feel the changes coming down
I wanna know what I've been hiding

Cleansing I've endured in

Take and give and to move
Learn and love and to cry
Kill and die and to be
Paranoid and to lie
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through
I choose to live and to lie
Kill and give and to die
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through

See my shadow changing
Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side
Step into the shadow

This is a song for the ladies
But fellas…listen closely

You don't always have to fuck her hard
In fact sometimes that's not right to do
Sometimes you've got to make some love
And fucking give her some smooches too
Sometimes you got to squeeze
Sometimes you got to say please
Sometime you got to say, hey

I'm gonna fuck you softly
I'm 'onna screw you gently
I'm 'onna hump you sweetly
I'm 'onna ball you discreetly

And then you say, ""Hey I brought you flowers""
And then you say, ""Wait a minute Sally
I think I got something in my teeth
Could you get it out for me?"" That's fucking teamwork

What's your favorite posish?
That's cool with me, it's not my favorite but I'll do it for you
What's your favorite dish?
I'm not gonna cook it but I'll order it from Zanzibar

And then I'll fucking bone you completely

Rock bottom, where them cops got a problem at
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at

From 2-1-5, it's him, the livest one

Hold me closer in these
Trying times, open your eyes

You said you felt something for me (Talk to 'em)
I don't know when
Based on the signals you send
Based on the way you apologized
When you came to see me and then (Then what?)
You had the nеrve to defend (Dеfend what?)
Mistakes that you made at the end
You said I was too invested
And that's what had forced you to go and pretend
I swear you crazy
Someone that's close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends (Oh)

Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend (Woo)
And it's wrong, I know (Know, know, know)
But again (Ooh, yeah)

I get along better with your friend (Oh)
And it's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, oh

No
You said you felt, you said you felt
Something that's different from everyone else
You had the nerve to still ask for my help
Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
You said you fell
And I took your word that night in our hotel
One thing about time, surely, time's gonna tell
Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
Can't let it go, can't get this out of me
This shit still bothers me
Don't you dare (Don't you dare)
Don't say you're proud of me
Hurt's just unreal to me
Now you wanna come crack to me (Crack, crack)
Three whole years after me
Why did you wait 'til the end?

But now I get along better with your friend, friend
And it don't feel wrong, but again

Night crawl with the lights off
You see a lot of life lost for the white horse
Regardless, the charges making us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market

Approach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feeling of course is, somethin' that's hard to describe
I'm half-dead, never felt more alive
Reborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down, but now I'm back up
I'm about to act up, boy, you better back up
And when you see me set up shop, know to pack up
Cause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up
Number one reason y'all should give rap up
Dice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up

I'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet

At the show, I start it with a, ""Can I get a ho?""
And the hoes go retarded

When I was a young boy
Growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners
Singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks
Tryna find the big fun
Looking for some trouble
Or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy
In the ghetto
Didn't know what my life would be
In the ghetto
I was dumb and oh so lazy
In the ghetto
Something had a spell on me

You wanna know what I'm talking 'bout?
Talking 'bout ghetto life

You wanna know what I'm singing 'bout?
Talking 'bout ghetto life

When I was a young man
Kind of free and fancy
Met this little cute girl
She said her name was Nancy
She had pigtails to her shoulders
She couldn't have been much older
She taught me what I had to know
To make a girl not wanna go
She was young and kinky
In the ghetto
She laid her pigtails down on me
In the ghetto
And I was young and oh so sneaky
In the ghetto
I had to see what love could be
In the ghetto
Listen

I knew it all along
That my game was strong
But I was wrong that time
I knew I had to play
And give myself away
Did you think I was man enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was smart enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was strong enough?
Yeah
Did you think that I'd work it out?

Sing it 'til you feel it when you say
Talking 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto life, you got to get on over
Talking 'bout ghetto life

Tenements, slums and corner bums
Playing tag with winos
The only way to have some fun
One thing 'bout the ghetto
You don't have to hurry
It'll be there tomorrow

Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that’s the way I remember her best

I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed

In the brightness of my day

I'm coming over
See me down at the station by the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain that was drowning all the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back porch fence just to see the dogs running
With a ring and a question
And my shivering voice is singing through a crack in the window

See me standing on a makeshift road with the dust storm blowing
In a long black shadow
Pull a hammer from a coal mine down where your daddy was working
Comb my hair back
Strike a match on a bathroom wall where my number is written
Driving on the sidewalk
Looking back and the sky is burning in my rear-view mirror

Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red, and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mm...

Another turnin' point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it

22,"I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains

Once at night cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain
Of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Na, na, na, na, na

La, la, la, la, la, la
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains
(Wordless vocals)

In the cantina
Margarita keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and 'round in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance
Dance Margarita, don't you know that I love you?
Dance
You're under arrest

My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and wise

I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff, I'm alright

I don't know just where I'm goin'
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushin' on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closin' in on death
You can't help me, not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Goin' from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life, haha
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
Heh, and that blood is in my head

You searched for me all among
The knowledgeable air

I was hidden, babe
I was hiding all away
I was hidden, dear
I was hiding all away

You entered the cathedral
When you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the bell

I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away

You asked an electrician
If he'd seen me around his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face

I was hidden, dear
I was hiding all away
I was not there, dear
I was hiding all away

You went and asked your doctor
To get some advice
He shot you full of Pethadine
And then he went and billed you twice

But I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away
But I was hiding, dear
Hiding all away
You approached a high court judge
You thought he'd be on the level
Well he wrapped a rag around your face
And beat you with his gavel

I was hiding, babe
I was hiding all away
I was keeping hidden, dear
I was hiding all away

You asked at the local constabulary
They said, he's up to his same old tricks
They leered at you with their baby blues
And rubbed jelly on their sticks

I had to get out of there, babe
I was hiding all away
You better get out of there, dear
I was hiding all away

You searched through all my poets
From Sappho through to Auden
I saw the book fall from your hands
As you slowly died of boredom
I had been there, dear
But I was not there anymore
I had been there, dear
Now I'm hiding all way

You walked into the hall of fame
And approached my imitators
Some were stuffing their faces with caviar
Some were eating cold potatoes

But I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away

Well, you asked a famous cook if he'd seen me
He opened his oven wide
Well, he basted you with butter, babe
And he made you crawl inside

But I was not in there, dear
I was hiding all away
I was not in there, dear
I was hiding all away

You asked the butcher
Who lifted up his cleaver
Stuck his fist up your dress
Said ""he must've been mad to leave you""

But I had to get away, dear
I was hiding all away
I had to get away, dear
I was hidden all away

Some of us we hide away
Some of us we don't
Some will live to love another day
And some of us won't
But we all know there is a law

Flame trees line the streets
Can't remember anything at all

But I'm driving my car down to Geneva

I've been sitting in my basement patio
Aye it was hot up above
Girls walk past, their roses all in bloom
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson Blues?
I'm going down to Geneva, baby
Gonna teach it to you
Who cares?
Who cares what the future brings?

Black road long and I drove and drove
And came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson with a 10-dollar guitar
Strapped to his back looking for a tune
Ah, well here comes Lucifer with his canon law
And a hundred black babies running from his genocidal jaw
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil, man
Don't know who is gonna rip off who

Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singing the Higgs Boson Blues
I'm tired, I'm looking for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped
In Memphis now in the Lorraine Motel
It's hot, it's hot - that's why they call it the Hot Spot
I'll take a room with a view
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yeah
And making the hot cots in the flophouse bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
And a bellhop hops and bops
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues

And if I die tonight
Bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
That the caliphate forced on the Jews
Ah, can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat?

Hannah Montana does the African Savannah
As the simulated rainy season begins
She curses the queue at the zoo loos
And moves on to Amazonia
And cries with the dolphins
Mau Mau ate the pygmy
The pygmy ate the monkey
The monkey has a gift
That he is sending back to you
Look, here comes the missionary
With his smallpox and flu
He's saving them, the savages
With his Higgs Boson Blues

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world


Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins

329,"Next morning, a crowd gathered on the Common, hypnotised by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated...


A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly Heat Ray...


People clawed their way off the Common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety, this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home, I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep...


I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit, and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life; working, eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept the Common, and the Heat Ray was ready to follow...


In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the edge of the Common, to form a cordon. That evening, there was a violent crash, and I realised with horror that my home was now within range of the Martian's Heat Ray. At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist, landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder...

We suffer and dream
And ride on a steel blade
One more exit home

I'm relying on your senses
My equilibrium is failing
The hole in me
Rips a hole in you

I didn't want to hurt you
I had to make a snap move
I didn't think you'd notice
But now I see your purpose
Stay up late with me
Stay up until the softness fades
And we're not afraid

The pain begins to finally fade away
And my old thinking has been blown away
What can you see
From your steel hive?
A thousand ways to lose your purpose
A thousand more to make it worth it

I didn't want to hurt you
I had to make a snap move
I didn't think you'd notice
But now I see your purpose
Stay up late with me
Stay up until the softness fades
And we're not afraid

Fooled by features in cannibal skies
This promise lies

432,"On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out

892,"How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""

Goes away in the end
And you could have it all

I will let you down
I will make you hurt

Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose; description
The spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep, deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone; feelings
Raw and exposed
When I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole, never to be found

It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire, both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole never to be found

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (Woo!)

See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh

If I can see it (Woo!), then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door

I believe I can fly

When you're feeling like a lover, nothing really matters anymore
I saw you standing there in the supermarket
With your red dress falling and your eyes are to the ground
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters when the one you love is gone

It's still in me, baby I need you
In my heart, I need you

Cause nothing really matters
I'm standing in the doorway
You're walking 'round to my place
In your red dress, hair hanging down
With your eyes on one, we love the ones we can
Cause nothing really matters when you're standing

Standing
I need you, need you

Cause nothing really matters
We followed the lines in the palms of our hands
You're standing in the supermarket
Nothing, holding hands
In your red dress, falling, falling in, falling in
The long black cars waiting 'round
I will miss you when you're gone
I'll miss you when you're gone away forever
Cause nothing really matters
I thought I knew better, so much better

And I need you
I need you

Cause nothing really matters
Oh the night we wrecked like a train
Purring cars in the pouring rain
Never felt right about it, never again
Cause nothing really matters
Nothing really matters anymore

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today

I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb

I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""

Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays

Firewood and bad wine long since gone
But I'm still drunk and hot
Wide awake and breathing hard

I've become jealous, rail-thin, prone to paranoia when I'm stoned
If this isn't true love, someone oughta put me in a home
Say, do you wanna get married?
And put an end to our endless progressive tendency to scorn
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your Daddy's farm
For love to find us of all people
I never thought it'd be so simple

Let's buy a plantation house
And let the yard grow wild until we don't need the signs that say, ""Keep out""
I've got some money left and it's cheaper in the South
I need someone I can trust
To protect me from our seven daughters when my body says ""enough""
Don't let me die in a hospital
I'll save the big one for the last time we make love

The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET, and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you and do the same shit to me
When you look at me, you see just a nigga from the projects

Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in a black Impala looking for the dollar sign

You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars

Iced honey
Iced honey

Now me, I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats

In iced honey
Iced honey (Iced honey!)

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good

Iced honey
Iced honey (Iced honey!)

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence marks your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of a-some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder, no need to wonder
Where you are
It might seem like Hell, the river Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
A butterfly heart
Flies right past you

Nothing to do

I crave more luxury disposables
A beautiful gym to have a heart attack in

Human life and burial
Is as important as survivors make it
Take my skin and make something
Burn the waste, leave my bones naked

You ate at your desk
Life-wide pressure
Stress-induced aneurysm
Dark spots cluster
A no-edged sword
Like an ATV on fire parked indoors

Human life and burial
Is as important as survivors make it
Take my skin and make something
Burn the waste, leave my bones nakеd
Everyone on my block
Who speaks English is drunk
Submit to thе virus
Un-bless yourself with luck

A rhizome of frayed nerves
As the market bell sounds
Duly wrapped in twenty suits
Stuffed with phoenix down
No church, no pews, no walls
Feedback drowns all of your calls
A curse on all of our lips
For the king who only sits
Deep breaths on a discount bus
Ignore all else, put the price on us
The brain inside your phone
Knows how to get you home
Which of the three will you work for?
Do you remember the name of the store?
Rent space in a minimalist grid
And dig for the treasures they hid
But which of the three will you pray for?
Have you recalled the name of your lord?
Tell the world how much you pay the man who prays for you

To Anne-Marie on my birthday
Said she could help, but just sent money
Get an hour out of town
Thought the state would turn around
Thought the job would work for you
Thought the sky would still be blue
Twenty-three by eighty-four by twenty-eight
Turns to hope for peaceful death
Evoked potential in droves
Twenty-three by eighty-four by twenty-eight
Turns to hope for peaceful death

I don't believe in an interventionist god
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did, I would kneel down and ask him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Oh, not to touch a hair on your head
Leave you as you are
If he felt he had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder if that's true
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch over you
Oh, to each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk like Christ in grace and love
And guide you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

But I believe in love
And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candles burning
And make her journey bright and pure
That she'll keep returning
Always and evermore

Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior struggling to remain consequential

Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in

Tales told of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin

Beating tired bones
Tripping through remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down

Warrior struggling to remain relevant
Warrior struggling to remain consequential

Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
Where I end

And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love

When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear

Here from the king's mountain view
Here from the wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan, I do
On treasures and flesh never few

But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day

The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown
But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me 'round

So I, I, I, I
I would, I would, I would wish this all away

Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along

But I, I would
If I could, then I would
Wish it away, wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away
No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away my center

So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You, my peace of mind, my all, my center
Just tryin' to hold on one more day
Damn my eyes, damn my eyes
Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
If wants and needs divide me, then I might as well be gone

Shine down upon the broken
Shine until the two become one

Crash landed in a field
Near the River Adur

You cried beneath the dripping trees

Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed I know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again
But now I know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath you saved my soul
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all these tears
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began he took your love away
But I still say

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be my love
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side

Would you come to me? Would you pull me up?
Would the effort really hurt you?
Is it unfair to ask you, to help pull me up?

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior, pull me up by my hair?
Now would you kiss me, on my lips?

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Now shoots out its tiresome message
Won’t you pull me up?
Scalding, my dead father has the motor and he's driving
Towards an island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness

Would you drop the mental bullet?
Would you pull me by the arm up?
Would you still kiss my lips?

And maybe we could send those kids to play down on the street
And shouldn't you put shoes on their feet?

Tippy toe, tippy toe, tippy toe, tippy toe coming out of backstage

Now I know that you don't really dig him
And I can see that you want it to quit
But if you want to get your hand out of the cookie jar
You have to let go of the biscuit

Yeah, I want you
Yeah, I wanna be your solitary man
I wanna be that man

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

People cry and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

Blue denim, spiked wrists and 'Crombie
Slap-screws and tattoos, that's all me
Two blondes, both arms, feelin' like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whippin' it might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court, smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm, I'm gnarly, baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly, baby
And you know the flow ungodly, baby

This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know

Well, this is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, ohhh

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Did you say, ""No, this can't happen to me!""
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind
In the back of your mind
Saying maybe
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
Ooohh, didn't know

And open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin

I'm reaching for the random or

You made a miracle, mother
I'll make a man out of me

Daddy, where's the sun gone from the sky?

Let love be your energy

When your love shines down on me

Every tear that you cry
Will be replaced when you die
Why don't you love your brother?
Are you out of your mind?

What did we do wrong, why did it die?
And if you've got no love for me then I'll say goodbye

Go for it
One, two

Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Till all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting, running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability

Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street

As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you

Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat

After he took from you everything he could steal?

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone


And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders

It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle

And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about

So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man

It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'

Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'

I lost myself on a cool, damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me? Nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

There's an army on the dance floor
It's a fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes, and

They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart, but not in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?

Oh, oh, oh, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Mmh

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

Oh... Ohh... Ohhhhh... Ohhhhhh...
Ohh..... lover, you should've come over
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, I, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done

How long will I wait for you?

On candy stripe legs, the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim, shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly, a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do, and I realize with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
Quietly he laughs, shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
""Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight""
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold

Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap

Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly

And I spun on my wheel like a laboratory rat

I was an electrical storm on the bathroom floor, clutching the bowl
My blood was full of gags and other people's diseases
My monstrous little memory had swallowed me whole
It was the year I officially became the Bride of Jesus

In love, in love, in love you laugh
In love you move, I move
And one more time with feeling
For love, you love, I laugh, you love
Saw you in half
And the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh, the urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming
I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues
And I had a sudden urge to become someone, someone like you
Who started out with less than anyone I ever knew

In love, in love, I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I move, you move
And one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I'm sawn in half
And all the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh and oh, you come shyly, softly to the hole to drink
Come as far as the edge of my blood, and then swim
And in the bathroom mirror I see me vomit in the sink
And all through the house we hear the hyena's hymns

Of love, I love, you love, I love, you love
I laugh, you laugh, I move, you move, you move
And one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh

I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned

I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime

Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do

It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""only God can judge me,"" 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me

I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked

Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams

Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

You lie and deceive

And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I'll follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist

The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away

I prayed heaven today
Would bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it

I dragged all that I owned
Down a dirt road to find you
My shoes worn out and used
They can't take me much farther

Something always takes the place of
Missing pieces you can take and
Put together even though
You know there's something missing

The sun burned a hole in my roof
I can't seem to fix it
I hope the rain doesn't come
And wash me down the gutter

Something always takes the place of
Missing pieces you can take and
Put together even though
You know there's something missing

She rides in a car like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that was broke, tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert, a beach with no treasure
A night that's so blue, feed the aching in you
In the background birds take a flight from the earth
Where the bonfire burns and the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating down a river of sleep
I can't see her hollow eyes

Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away


When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away

From a long night in the storm
Looked up this morning
Saw the roses full of thorns
Mountains are falling
They don't have nowhere to go
The ocean's a diamond
That only shines when you're alone
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I've lost all my defenses
This morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be?

We've gone all around
Till there's nothing left to say
We've worn it all down
Into something that couldn't be saved
You tore it all down
And bury me underneath the weight

But can we start it all over again?

Strength, the strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number and my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun

Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined


There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real

No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest, let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration

Looking for a ladder in the stratosphere
So I can be happy, let my bones melt away
Stranded on a plane that was circling round
I carry my heart like a soldier with a hand grenade
Walking down the aisle of the supermarket
Looking for the things for to carry my senses away
Listen to the ring of the telephone
Somebody's calling, somebody who's all alone
Looking for a home in the magazine page
Wages in my pocket gonna buy me anything that I need
A switch in my brain, the battery light
Wash me away, gaping at the oceans below
And I'm not scared 'cause there's nobody there
My mind is awake and anything could lead me astray
Listen to the voice on the radio wave
Somebody needs you, somebody who's far away

Just like everyone
To lie here and die among the sorrows
Adrift among the days
For everything I ever said
And everything I've ever done is gone
And dead

As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part

Blessed and cursed and won
Time heals but I'm forever broken
By and by the way
Have you ever heard the words
I'm singin' in these songs?
It's for the girl I've loved all along
Can a taste of love be so wrong?

As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part

And in my mind as I was floating
Far above the clouds
Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinkin' that I'd live forever

But I knew exactly where I was
And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul
And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And the world, so hard to understand
And the world, you can't live without

My friends are so depressed
I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

Alone and desperate on the prison phone
They want to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you

So hard and lonely too

My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

So hard and lonely too

Taught by tragedy
Release is peace

I heard a little girl
And what she said was something beautiful
""To give your love no matter what""
Was what she said

I love all of you

Could take you to the moon, rake you in the leaves
And keep you just the same all in my arms

Farther than an ocean, closer than a soul

Every new direction, closer you would get
The farther away you go from where we went

Pushes up beyond and all they come from home

Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's going to warn you
And no one's going to yell, ""Attack!""
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hanging out your back

I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room

The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling
From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere
There be no shelter here
Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memories erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR

The market bulls got pockets full

The poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he's got a dope pair of Nikes on
Godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler

A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go

Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you

Bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes, you can, like ""Can I Kick It?"" Wicked
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope Diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit
(Zzzt!) A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beats got family members askin' him for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em, ""Clean it""
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said, ""Nah, fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?""

If I had to lose a mile

I would lose my soul

I don't have to think

Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?
Invented at your birth

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
Formulate infinity

Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner
Now I rock a teller suit, lookin like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown-up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones
I move onward, the only direction

I used to drink Cristal, the muh'fucker's racist
So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit
You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I drop the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen
Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, help me

Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine, has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight


Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home

When the willow bends towards the end of day
And twilight falls again
To the funny sound that a blackbird makes
Twilight falls again
As no good reason remains
I'll do the same, thinking of you

One day a ship comes in
One day a ship comes in
But I can't say how or when
But I know somewhere a ship comes in every day

There is no morphine
I'm only sleeping
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take something with you
It would be bright
Something good

From my fingertips
The cigarette throws ashes to the ground
I'd stop and talk to the girls who work this street
But I got business farther down
Like one long season of rain
I will remain thinking of you

One day a ship comes in
From far away a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it
And you know somewhere a ship comes in every day

There is no morphine
I'm only sleeping
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take something with you
It would be bright
Just like something good

One day a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it

When I heard the Ladies' Man was dead
I saw the rolling stone stop moving
Saw my ancient hero on the Sunset Strip
He left behind a legacy of ruin
Now painted ladies want to hold my gun
Wonder if the whole time I'd been acting
When I sang ""Moon River"" in that silent film
Had I really made a sound when they called ""Action""?

I swear that man was womankind's first husband
They all died in a line to save him
I'm a steady hand, I'm a Dodgers fan
I'm a leading brand, I'm a one-night stand
I'm a ladies' man

Ooh, only son of the Ladies' Man
Ooh, only son of the Ladies' Man

Couldn't see his used up body at the funeral
By virtue of the flailing of his conquests
They tied down his casket with a garter belt
Each troubled heart was beating in a sequined dress
Someone must console these lonesome daughters
No written word or ballad will appease them
The cowboy and the cop shot down the Ladies' Man
The humid nights in LA are now silent

Out of the black? It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why and you didn't care when
It closed every door, and washed away no sin
And I promised you like you promised me
But those vows we made fucked it up for free

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to

Ready for a cheap escape
On the brink of self-destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of anguish
Mass confusion

Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with ""I don't care""

There's a plague inside of me
Eating at my disposition
Nothing's left
Torn out of reality
To a state of no opinion
Limp with hate

Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with ""I don't care""

Ooh, I shocked the Sunday school and did that shit there on purpose
See, I'm a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose

New York, New York is the mothership where I used to smoke dust and shit
Now, I'm crop dusting fuckers, suck it up and you'll love the shit

I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands

And an illustrated book about birds

Who needs action when you got words

When you've finished with the mop, then you can stop
And look at what you've done

And the work, it was fun

Some say it was Greenland, and some say Mexico

The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen
They killed us in our tepee
They cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share
I wish I was a trapper
I would give a thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the mornin'
On the fields of green
In the homeland

And maybe Marlon Brando

No, I don't care
I mean, hey, I got Penny
'There comes a time in every girl's life when she's really got to ask herself deep down inside
""Is she ready to be going steady?""
Don't  it away
But I honestly believe that one month should be enough
Well, first of all, let's see if dating this one boy Johnny
And one day Johnny asked me to be his steady girl
There comes a time where she's got to ask herself
""Steady or not? I mean, do you really want to be Johnny's steady?""
Don't think that a woman could honestly believe that one month should be just about enough
Well, first of all, let's see if dating that one boy Johnny a few times

Three important rules for breaking up
Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to
Prolonging the situation only makes it worse
Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly
Don't make a big production
Don't make up an elaborate story
This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene
If you want to date other people say so
Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected
Even if you've gone together for only a short time
And haven't been too serious
There's still a feeling of rejection
When someone says she prefers the company of others
To your exclusive company
But if you're honest, and direct
And avoid making a flowery emotional speech
When you break the news
The boy will respect you for your frankness
And honestly he'll appreciate the kind and
Straightforward manner in which you told him your decision
Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you'll remain friends

I'm head of the class
I'm popular
I'm a quarterback

My mom says I'm a catch

Being attractive is the most important thing there is
If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond
You have to be as attractive as possible
Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean
Wash it at least every two weeks
Once every two weeks
And if you see Johnny Football Hero in the hall
Tell him he played a great game
Tell him you liked his article in the newspaper

I'm the party star
I'm popular
I've got my own car
I'm popular
I'll never get caught
I'm popular
I make football bets
I'm the teacher's pet
I propose we support a one month limit on going steady
I think It would keep people more able to deal with weird situations
And get to know more people
I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny
Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit
He won't mind, he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating
And once you've dated someone else, you can date him again
I'm sure he'll like it
Everyone will appreciate it
You're so novel, what a good idea
You can keep your time to yourself
You don't need date insurance
You can go out with whoever you want to
Every boy, every boy in the whole world could be yours
If you'll just listen to my plan

Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours

Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

You know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Got my hands bound
And my head down and my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

Do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto others what has been done to you

I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Release in sodomy
For one sweet moment I am whole

Do unto you now what has been done to me
Do unto you now what has been done

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
Release in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
And only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind

Got your hands bound
And your head down
And your eyes closed
You look so precious now

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit, blood, and cum on my hands
I've come 'round full circle

My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon

1198,"The comedy of man starts like this:
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so nature, she devised this alternative:
We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since
Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's gotta go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you gonna to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just wait until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being
Endowed this horror show with meaning

Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks
These unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics
Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents a cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals


Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony:
Their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave
Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive
Is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request
Is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we've got",Pure Comedy,Father John Misty,Doloristic,1.71864178670518,2017-04-07,133,26,46,-12,16,6:24,81,0,1322,2089,76.75,-3.09,7.37,68.36,-17.88,13.86,50.57,-3.45,14.03,50.69,-17.6,21.13,-55.386091127098304,-23.1654676258993,-49.9893992932862,-55.5759717314488,-26.4338394793926,-19.3817787418655,-24.5061728395062,-39.3148148148148,2094,1132,1100,1100,0.5253104106972302,0,0.2813757047982536,0.127903623979468

Fuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore

You see, life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Nations going to war for the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record store, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore

Yo, desire and lust can make a man kill
Or jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil
So it's promoted like it's all y'all know
Keep a nigga under the spell, you under control
But yo, I seen it make people slit they wrists
Weakness, pussy make a spy say secrets
But what for? Cause sex is the law
And been many an empire rise and fall
From the squares to the players
To the pimps to the whores
To big checks that never would have been endorsed
Ya know, I sit back and just peep thangs
9 outta 10, it's the same songs, only the beat change
So don't be lookin' at Tariq strange
When I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range
That's when you see me up on stage with six
Wicked ass chicks fittin to get crunk with this
Life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Corporations going to war over the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record stores, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore

Yo, fresh cut, with the thick black velour
With the black Louis sneaks, headed out for tour
Lookin' out the limo window up at the billboards
200 miles, she was the only thing I saw
Promotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine
Cell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings
You gotta show a little skin to get them listening
For real yo, the world is a sex machine
Full of pretty freaks in designer jeans
That go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes
Half the time, it ain't even responsibly
Tryin' to take me some place I'm not tryin to be
Ghetto, Sin City, where the P is free
You catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3
All up in the after-hours on the second floor

Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately, I've been skeptical, silent when I would use to speak
Distant from all around me who witness me fail and become weak
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged

It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
So you leave, and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find

You and me, we're through and rearranged

You're no good for me
Thank God it's over
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dying

I'm just about done... Yo, let me finish tuning this guitar...
Yo, y'all ready for the show?

Ready or Not! Here we come! All the biting M.C.'s and the pirates, I go run!
(Why?)Cause they are old! And we are young!
And while we're young, yes we're gonna have some fun! Here we go!
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity whoa!! Swing! (Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!)
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity WHOA!!! SWING!! (Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!)

You should've have died before you reach this station
Refugees we run the Border! Ay! Ay!...Ay! Ay!
You should've have died before you reach this station
Refugees we all go Murder! Now!!!

Yo! Now that I escape, selling four million plates
My beeper vibrates, like California earthquakes
But I keep a balanced head, cause you're hot, they're not
M.C.'s go Hollywood, then lose their spot on the jukebox
Still ichi bang, wack M.C.'s get the gong!
Lyrical tongue, wireless mics from Samsung
Wyclef, seduced once by an actress
Angela Basset wanted the head of Jean Baptiste
Meanwhile across town I still owe money to Carlito
Mama always say don't gamble; I'm trapped in casino
No more money in my bags; nightmares, getting closer
I slept on Elm Street, Freddy Kruger woke up with a German Luger
Black serial killer, man turns to gorilla
Provoked I change faces like Michael Jackson's Thriller
B-B-B-B-B-Boo! And you don't stop!!!

Ready or Not! Here we come! All the biting M.C.'s and the pirates, I go run!

Well won't ya, grab the mic and lead the blind to the light?!

If I could change the times, make rhymes, raise the babies
Give all the pigs rabies, send biting niggas to Haiti's
Clothe young ladies; chase the rainbow, find the pot
Free the third time offender once he learns to makes-a-lot
Lose the fame, take the money; Play boys, just like the bunny
Find a man with a plan, Slap a chicken, If she acts funny
Break the bank, on tank Stop niggas from acting stank
Take over your vouch free Rovers Teach a man to find Jehovah
Own the stores, own the tours Watch the record, pimps and whores
Make love, stop the wars Cop the land, like the laws
Make the last be the first, make the God respect the Earth
Change the murder rate to the birth! (Swing!)

Hey yo, Pras where you at?-I'm just adjusting my mic
Well won't ya, grab the mic and make the crowd react!

No more tours, no more scores
Por favor senor, I do the soundbite from here to El Salvador
Ready to take over, like that! (Gun cocks)
Run your whole crew over, like that!! (Gunshot)
Buffalo soldier! Dreadlock rasta! Rather be slaughtered than be captured!
Three refugees, one usual suspect
Trapped in the firm, cause he fell to two techs
Prospects have thoughts, blood in like outlets
I can read your whole flow, just like a pamphlet
Thousands and thousands of watts, high volt!
Body as a Q-Tip, right on the asphalt
Tell the truth that you shouldn't sky off
This is Mr. Prakazrel, I don't take it as an insult
I grab the money, money! Stash the cash-n-dash, peddle on the gas
I'm clear like Everlast!

Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams

You'll see him in your head, on the TV screen

I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole
Defeated
I concede and move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)

And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
So let the light touch you so that the words spill through
And let the past break through, bringing out our hope and reason

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said ""Damn, what's next?""
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate


I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

A day when you were young
Free to play alone with time
Evening never come

Sing a song that can’t be sung
Without the morning’s kiss
Queen – you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king

We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!

We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk

From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission, to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation

Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me

Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin' and sockin' and rockin' and puttin' a side of hip-hop

Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of HIP-HOP!!

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat, we get fresh

Come on

Come on

There was a time when our music
Was something called ""The Bay Street"" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor

Revive void within

Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Picture this if you will

10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes
In my ""need to know"" pose, just outside of Area 51
Contemplating the whole ""chosen people"" thingy
When just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
Like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
And stopping right at my Birkenstocks
And me yelping, ""holy fucking shit""
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit

Then the X-File being
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
With Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
Vanilla Chig Champa
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
And my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip
And all I could think was
""I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
That I pissed my fuckin' pants""
So light in his way, like an apparition, that
He had me crying out
""Fuck me, it's gotta be
The Deadhead Chemistry
The blotter got right on top of me
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T""

And after calming me down
With some orange slices
And some fetal spooning
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose
He said, ""You are the chosen one
The one who will deliver the message
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
And a warning for those who do not""
Me, the chosen one
They chose me
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school

You'd better
You'd better
You'd better listen

With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down

See, my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

I can't breathe right now
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sorta terrifying

While I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally, it's my lucky day
See, my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

I can't breathe right now
You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I've just said
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See, they took me by the hand
And invited me right in

I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like

You had all of them on your side
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?

The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left
In my fucking world is wearing your disease

How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so hard?
How'd it get so long?

You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you? Didn't you?

The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know

How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd it get so long?

I'm walking through the other side
With the devil trying to take my mind
And my soul's just a silhouette
From the ashes of a cigarette

Illusions never fake their lies
And trick cards fool the eye
Carry zeros over 'til they add up
Bury tears in the chapters you shut

Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's too plain to tell
All alone but living well
The scarecrow's only scaring himself

I've been digging the ground and the dust and the clouds
I see miles and miles and junkyard piles
I wanted hope from a grave, I wanted strength from a slave
What gives you comfort now might be the end of you then

Crows are pulling at my clothes
The wind got my fingers froze
Standing all day keeping watch
Over all the treasures we've lost

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion

Me and Fast got the gats, we're out to rob the bank
We got Steve outside carrying a full pack
Now everything's cool and everything's smooth
Hey that's smooth...
I walked up to the teller, I gave her the letter
She gives me the loot with puckered up lips and a wink
That I found cute and I said, ""Baby, baby, baby...""
Is this some karmic-chi love thing happening here baby or what?
By that time Fast tapped me with the 9
He said it was time to blow, you know
So out the door we go back to the ride with Steve inside
And alive, and off we drive
See, I hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far
Riding around in a stolen police car
So we dropped it off and piled in a Caddy
Steve was driving because I had to talk to my man about something

""Look, I don't know anything about any fucking set-up
You can torture me all you want...""

He was standing at the rock, gathering the flock
And getting there with no directions
And underneath the arch it turned into a march
And there he found the spark to set this fucker off

And he lay in need of some attention
And there he played his card, going into shock

He drives a Chevy Malibu

And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

Once upon a time
I was of the mind
To lay your burden down
And leave you where you stood
You believed I could
You'd seen it done before
I could read your thoughts
And tell you what you saw
And never say a word
But now all that is gone
Over with and done
Never to return

And I can tell you why
People die alone
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun

Staring at the loss
Looking for the cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned

And I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun


Shapes of every size
Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within
Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lived inside my skin

They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate


He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate",Simple Twist of Fate,Bob Dylan,Stoiostatic,1.91861479181324,1975-01-17,137,26,41,-16,36,4:17,67,57,122,3662,62.75,-8.09,11.37,54.36,-22.88,17.86,36.57,-8.45,18.03,36.69,-22.6,25.13,-55.386091127098304,-3.16546762589928,-49.9893992932862,-35.5759717314488,-26.4338394793926,0.61822125813449,-24.5061728395062,-19.3148148148148,1333,681,702,681,0.5108777194298575,1,0.4275619871731825,0.0842759195209799

Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, it's too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes

In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame? It's a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue

Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified been fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead

When Mom and Dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed; said, ""Please, don't go!""

Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!

She said, ""Why don't you stop your crying?
Go outside and ride your bike""
That's what I did, I killed my toe!

Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!

Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile

Was it a story or was it a song?
Was it overnight or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?

Woke in my warm bed
Just in time for all the brilliant red lights
They were streaming through my half-shuttered window
Christmas lights in time with my stuttered brain waves
The door knob was glowing
All my photographs were rippled and melting
Through the walls I could hear panicked voices
They seemed to say, ""go back to bed there's no choices
And nowhere not burned out""

Smoking umbrella left

To all their shouted questions, just lay back choking
Didn't want to stay but my bed was on fire
Instead of screaming I fell back into dreamland
Blinking and sighing

And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate
And I never stepped on the cracks cause I know I'd hurt my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under
Pulled me under

Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off

And I don't even need your love (Ooh)

Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with, like death
Riding on top of the car
Peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate
I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'Cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street?
Greeting everybody like the Good Humor man
And they got the taste of good humor
But no ice cream
It was like that, me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the numbers
And use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit?
Remember Steppen Fetchit, how we laughed?
And all your Sunday school images giving flesh and jiggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh, anyway

I can see something in the way of ourselves
That's why I say the things I do
You know it, but it's something else to you
Like that job
This morning, when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning, soft, behind you
Yearning for their nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled
My mistake is I kept sayin' ""that was proof God didn't exist""
And you told me, ""nah..."" Well, it's proof that the devil do
But still, it's like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag
Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk witch you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit
And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words, but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see
But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something to get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something, stalking us like an ugly thing floating at our back, calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say, ""It got a right to exist just like you
And if God made it..."" But then we got to arguin'
And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the mic is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?
The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too, but can't call its name
""Ain't it too bad?"" y'all said
""Ain't it too bad? Such a nice boy, always kind to his mother
Always said good morning to everybody on his way to work""
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad
I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things
That it worked on him like it do in will
And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You wanna know what?
You wanna know what I'm talkin' about?
Sayin' ""I seen something in the way of things""
And how the boy's face looked that day
Just before they took him away
The is in that face and remember now
Remember all them other faces
And all the many places you've seen 'em
Or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror
And didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face
Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw
And what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else?
Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow
Criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With his head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with
And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them
Into the jet stream of a black bird
With his ass on fire
Or the solemn not-ness of where we go
To know we gon' be happy
I seen something—I seen something!
And you seen it too! You seen it too
You just can't call its name

I think I hear the sounds of then and people talking
The scenes recalled by minute movement
And songs they fall from the backing tape
That certain texture, that certain smell

To lie in sweat on familiar sheets
In brick veneer on financed beds
In a room of silent HardieFlex
That certain texture, that certain smell

Brings home the heavy days
Brings home the the nighttime swell

Out on the patio we'd sit
And the humidity we'd breathe
We'd watch the lightning crack over cane-fields
And laugh and think, ""This is Australia""

The block is awkward, it faces west
Long diagonals and sloping, too
And in the distance, through the heat haze
In convoys of silence the cattle graze

That certain texture, that certain beat
Brings forth the nighttime heat

If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh

De wole ah wan', can't test when I wile out
I ain't gotta have a gang when I ride out
I just get my mind right then I slide out
'Cause if you're bait, one don will talk and everybody's gonna find out
I can bring a style out
Showcase the style, I put a vibe out
Pass me the water, I got a dry mouth
After that I spray a couple fire bars, make a shook spitter hide out
They ain't got the same drive
Do my ting at night or in the day time
Don't matter what time it is, I make time
And I have a Haze time and a break time
In a dance gyal a wine up your waistline
Everybody goin' mad to the bassline
Sippin' on a one drink at the same time
I power up around April and May times then I have a great time

The Tipping Point
The rains have saturated the ground upon which they exist, forty days and forty nights
Musical mediocracy
The Tipping Point
Filling every crack of our space
The kids have been packed to the tops of their lies with songs of empty smiles and hypnotic donkey rhythms, believe
The Tipping Point
That the sun will appear on this forty-first day
And the dove will bring word that art has not been drowned
And life music will thrust its branches from the bud of whackness
The Tipping Point
These sounds have changed
And the whisper where we began invade our nostrils like the smell of history's future
It sounds like the chorus of we
The Tipping Point
We were almost stoned to death for telling those who, yeah, would listen
The craziness
We have made it through these mazes of mediocracy, the not-quite-art supernova today
So, so make us give you more and we will

Lying on the floor
Staring into nothing
What the hell am I here for?
So come on and play
Stab it in my heart
So all this time was wasted
Ripping me apart

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

My time is over!
This time is over!
Why is this over?
God is gonna take me out!

Crawling on the floor
All around this space
Talking to myself
What is this thing I gotta face?
Walking through a door
Has it been a waste?
Going on and on
Thinking I could find my place

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak

Involved an under usual feat

Standing on the last legs

And asks me what I got to show
Besides the dust in my pockets
And the things that just eat away my soul

Haunting my brain
There's some permissions
Of a dream that got cremated

Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

You're gonna rise up singing
Yes you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But 'til that morning
There ain't nothin' can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standin' by

She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

My love, take my breath away

Through the hourglass, I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I'm unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me
God bless you workin' on a plan to heaven
Follow the lord all twenty-four-seven days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keepin' me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I'm guessin' my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold

Pick up your swords and fly

Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light

To bring the balance back
Bring it back

With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!

I beat my machine
It's a part of me, it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me, I am becoming

He's covered with scabs, he is broken and sore
The me that you know, he doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore

Drowns out all I hear

But the blood has stopped pumping and he is left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires

I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all of my bad parts

They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss

Flashing teeth of brass

So he could scream and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and lo! It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moonboys

With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that

The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks

He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature

Shooting up pie-in-the-sky

In the feeble and the bad

In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone

I'm starving for me gravy

You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it

I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements

684,"No one would have believed, in the last years of the nineteenth century, that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space. No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinised as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets. And yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly, and surely, they drew their plans against us...


At midnight, on the 12th of August, a huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth. Across two hundred million miles of void, invisibly hurtling towards us, came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth. As I watched, there was another jet of gas. It was another missile, starting on its way...


And that's how it was for the next ten nights. A flare, spurting out from Mars. Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it; a beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight. Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger. He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote, forbidding planet...

The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one...
But still, they come!

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth. It was thought to be an ordinary falling star, but the next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the Common, and Ogilvy came to examine what lay there. A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot, and with faint sounds of movement coming from within. Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing, and Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape. He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him before he could burn himself on the metal...

The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one...
But still, they come!
Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said

Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average

Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet

By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward

The signs in the sky won't let up
The clouds assume the shape
Of Catholic girls with uzis
All of them on the make
All of them out to make a million
By the time they hit thirteen
And it's all in the colour of the old sun setting
This brand new age of blood-letting
And it's all in the eyes of me

I'm suspicious of my wife
I suspect she left long ago
I recall my finger on the button of the ejector seat
But I can't recall letting her go
The electric Christ has canonised her
She's surrounded by a chemical glow
It has to be said
It's today's edition of the book of the dead
It has to be said

In this worst of all possible worlds
On this planet of perpetual sorrows
I found the best of all possible girls
She's as pure and white and bright as tomorrow

My life plays like Grand Guignol
Blood and portents everywhere
They say they can't remove these signs from my eyes
But I suspect that they just don't care
I've got a harsh new brand of aftershave
That gives you that thousand-yard stare
Why can't you get it through your head?
Now is the golden age of bloodshed
It needs to be said

We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night

All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing

Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you

We should have each other with cream

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so, so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
My son said, ""Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw""

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool""
But then you wind up droppin' out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

Overcome them, completely silent now
With Heaven's help

Around your neck and tug you off your cloud

Recall the deeds as if they're all
Someone else's atrocious stories
Now you stand reborn before us all
So glad to see you well

And I don't scream and kick

Circle around the park, joining hands in silence
Watch the evil black the sky
The storm has ripped the shelter of illusion from our brow
This power is no mystery to us now

Leave your spirit genocide, the cancer you won’t remove
We cast our funeral rose inside and bury the need to prove
Our mutilation is to gain from the system

Turn your head away from the screen, oh people
It will tell you nothing more
Don’t suck the milk of flaccid Bill K. Public’s empty promise
To the people that the public can ignore

This way of life is so devised to snuff out the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise, and women have learned to lose
Throw off your shame or be a slave to the system

I see you take another drag
One more lost soul to raise your flag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
Let’s see you take another drag

You like to dance to the rolling head of the adulteress
You sing in praise of suicide
We know you’re useless
Like cops at the scene of a crime
With your steroids and your feedbag and your stable and your trainer
I got a mail bomb for you, Mr. Strong Arm

Throw out the stones from all the cemetery homes
For the violence of a nation gone by
Or the politics of weakness and the garbage dump of souls
That will now black the sky

Their yellow haze and crowds of eyes will plug up the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise, and women have learned to lose
We'll share our bodies in disdain for the system

I see you take another drag
One nation bends to kiss the hag
The sky is a landfill

I see you take another drag

The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years
The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears
My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""",The Sound of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,Doloristic,1.92067290272219,1968-01-21,108,46,44,-10,53,3:05,14,0,249,4745,9.75,-5.09,-17.63,1.36,-19.88,-11.14,-16.43,-5.45,-10.97,-16.31,-19.6,-3.87000000000001,-35.3860911270983,13.8345323741007,-29.9893992932862,-18.5759717314488,-6.43383947939262,17.6182212581345,-4.50617283950617,-2.31481481481482,1165,606,622,606,0.5201716738197425,1,0.5393957166984218,0.0744803703261582

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last

Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, a wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Long grey cloak, tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

In, out, in, out, in, out

A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?

Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?

Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought, I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late
Supper's waitin' on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own

The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again

I know I'll make it, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth

And you can make it last forever, you
Can make it last forever, you
Can make it last

And for a moment, I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return

I'll make the effort, love can last forever

And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time

This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night

Than any ghoul would ever dare try

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all’s neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb

Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say
]

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees

Yo, I’m always early, I never take off
'Cause I've got a job: rob Peter to pay Paul
Now, I realize it’s the winner that takes all
Do what I gotta do because I can’t take loss
Picture me, living life as if I’m some animal
That consumes its own dreams, like I’m a cannibal
I won’t accept failure unless it’s mechanical
But still, the alcohol mixed with the botanical
I guess I be referred to the owners' manual full of loners
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets with eighth-grade diplomas
And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus
Look, let he without sin live without sin
Until then, I’ll be doing dirty jobs like swampmen
Counting the faces of those that I might've been
It’s like living that life, but I won’t live that life again

Lot of niggas go to prison—how many come out Malcolm X?
I know I'm not; shit, can't even talk about the rest
Famous last words: ""You under arrest""
Will I get popped tonight? It's anybody's guess
I guess a nigga need to stay cunning
I guess when the cops coming, need to start running
I won't make the same mistakes from my last run-in
You either done doing crime now, or you done in
I got a brother on the run and one in
Wrote me a letter—he said, ""When you coming?""
Shit, man, I thought the goal's to stay out
Back against the wall, then shoot your way out
Getting money's a style that never plays out
'Til you in a box, and your stash money’s paid out

On the command of men wearing money belts that buy mistresses sleek animal pelts

Too many puppies
Too many puppies
Too many pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-puppies
Too many puppies


Peanut sat on a railroad track
His heart was all a flutter
Along came the train
Toot, toot, peanut butter

Too many puppies with guns in their hands
Too many puppies in foreign lands
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war machine

Too many puppies are just like me
Too many puppies are afraid to see
The visions of the past brought to life again
Too many puppies, too many dead men

Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me

Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast

Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

What part of no don't you understand
(understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can

But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough

This is the greatest and best song in the world…
…tribute

Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said, “Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul” (Soul)

Well, me and Kyle, we looked at each other
And we each said, “Okay”
And we played the first thing that came to our heads, just so happened to be
The best song in the world, it was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow-ho

Needless to say, the beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail and the beast was done
He asked us *snort* “Be you angels?”
And we said, “Nay, we are but men!” Rock
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh, whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no

Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me, young god body

Fools get rowdy, ain't nothin' dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rollin' the finest
You know the fronto, Sucio Guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connects with Sandro, the illest y'all know
Killin' 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy, designer
But check my rhymes, though, my verse is like atomic bombs, yo

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

Yeah!

Yeah!

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again

Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?

I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya

Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother

“Forward!” he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?

Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round, and round

“Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?”
The poster bearer cried
“Listen, son,” said the man with the gun
“There's room for you inside”

I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean, he got off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of right and wrong, innit?
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?

It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about

Tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls
They whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while""
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks
To the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you, man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain

Cast the first stone if you feel you ain't a sinner
After eight stays, we resorted to rebell
I'm packin' up my Nine to remedy my stale (?)
Ask your local mechanic, he'll tell you my esophagus is very profane!
I'm even locking Stephen King in his own ending!
God damn it! You got static?! Drop your automatic!!!
Niggas fabricating lyrics with cheap fabrics!
All originale damn man is originale good! Bah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah!
 Ahh, look at the youths, sick of the violence
 Vocab baby, vocab!

The gorey got you hot cause you coop what you are!
But I've been rockin' mic's since the days of Babylon!
My pen was eucalyptus, and my rappin' was the scroll
I walked for many moons, and let the sandels jist to my control
You're swole cause you couldn't cross the burnin' sands
You never had no mercy when my people was in Egypt's land
Say, ""Yes I can!"" With the force of Elijah
Steppin' to you, they get irrigated like the Niger
So hide the cattle, Fugees come to battle
We'll take all your bounty, then we'll eat your vittles
I'm used to the type of poetics that mesmerize
I caught you checkin' with them Bette Davis eyes!
Surprise, surprise! You never knew a girl could stylize!
It's from the soul! I ain't freakin' with white lies
Yo, hey guys! Remember the summer of '92?
Battle after battle! Crew after crew!
So, hachoo! Fugees coming with a brand new style!
I'm rollin' with them hoodies from the H-A-I!
It takes awhile for them average niggas to get it
But once they understand they won't want to freak with this, see...
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird
Doin' shit you never heard, plus I come from the suburbs
Word to God! I heard ya had it kinda hard
And you got your skin scarred when they was shootin' on the boulevard!

You drop your drink, then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (Oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (Oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (Oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (Oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Holly came from Miami, F-L-A
Hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A. 
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

She says, ""Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side""
Said, ""Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side""

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom, she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

She says, ""Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side""
Said, ""Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side""

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said

""Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side""
I said, ""Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side""

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen him go, go, go

They said, ""Hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side""
I said, ""Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side""
Alright, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would've helped that bash
She said, ""Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side""

It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singing and clapping, man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound some were hell-bound, some they fell down
And some got back up and fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow

How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time

Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it

For it's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

Draw you in closer, make you want to listen to it
And if you real ill at making music, the listener feel like he living through it
That's how my nigga do it
I met Slacks back in Lyte, '91, rapping
We went to Millersville to get away from gun-clapping
It ain't last; I be in class dreaming 'bout
Fifty thousand fans up in the stands, screaming out:
""Encore!"" Yo, I'm headed back to Philly
Nigga, you rollin' with me? I'm tryna get busy
We walked dogs that was off the chain
Lot of times, at the shows, people hardly came
I just took it in stride as part of the game
But inside, people down with me started to change
It was a couple things: lil' syrup, lil' pills
Instead of riding out on the road, you'd rather chill
I know the way the pleasure feel—I'm not judging
But still I'm on a mission, yo, I'm not bugging
I got fam that can't stop drugging, they can't sleep
They can't stick to one subject, they can't eat
It's people steady coming at me out in the street
Like, ""'Riq, yo, what up with your peeps?"" It gets deep, nigga

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high

We done shared clothes and wheels, killed mics and reels
We done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors
Tryna figure what the fuck we getting slept on for
Or what we walking with the weapon for
Weighted by the gravity law
You'd know it if you came up poor, my nigga
Picture the bus up north
You know we made of everything outlaws are made of
I'm far from a hater
And I don't say I love you, 'cause the way I feel is greater
And M-Ila, you a poet, son, you a born creator
And this'll probably dawn on you later
It's in your nature, lyrics all on your walls like they made of paper
You got to find out where your talent take you
You might fuck around, finally make it
And that's real, but—

And when I walk the street, it's like a pharmacy
They got all type of shit anybody could get
It go from H to X to loosie cigarettes
For my ghetto legend, known for lil' sheist' running
Copped codeine by the quarts and keep comin'
Dumbing, just embracing the dope, like it's a woman
You burning both sides of the rope and just pulling, tugging
In between Islam and straight thugging
Laying every day around the way and doing nothing
See 'em looking, shaking their head, and start shrugging
If they don't got a man like mine, they got a cousin
Ayo, you better be a true friend to him
Before this shit put an end to him
Or give a pen to him
Or lock him in the studio with a mic
'Cause on the real, it might save his life—keep telling 'em!

Send a telegram, tell me your thoughts
I wanna live for a day in the way that we lost
But unfortunately, the Twain got crissed not crossed
Left the keys in the car so the legs have to walk
On a desert terrain, we were wayward and plain
Waiting for rain in a decade afraid
Of what pain might do to the pleasure we knew
Before we had to move on I did my best for you

Darker, we dance alone this way
It's getting darker, we dance alone this way

I waited for a fire to come out of the ground
I tried to get back on the world as it was turning around
Splinters and pieces from a life that crashed
Watching every minute of the wreckage go past
'Cause motions wearing down all my thoughts
'Til they're all smoothed out like rocks we tossed
Ducks and drakes over water we go
Where we see there's only memories drowning below

Darker, we dance alone this way
It's getting darker, we dance alone this way

On a gravel train, we were waiting for hope
I was a light fading out like a stray on a rope
I let the scenery pass like a blown-out TV
Thought I saw a ghost but it might have been me
Might have been the world that was moving too fast
Caught up in the future that was drunk on the past
Now looking for a place where the nights unravel
Last ditch road trespassers travel on

It's getting darker, we dance alone this way

Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee require skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin', and roam like a cellular phone

Keepin' your party jumpin' with an original somethin'

No imagination, excuse for perpetration

Joke's on you — you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but, um..

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothin' sacred
A-yo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme-sayin', rent-payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world, crowds love me from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb, and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to..

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short — ""I want It Made"" like Ed, 'nuff said!
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover my level is that of no other

Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Get what you want to if you want, because you can get anything

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas
And you make them long, and you make them tough
But they just go on and on, and it seems you can't get off


When you crack the sky, scrapers fill the air
Will you keep on building higher
Till there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?

Please let me make a true confession
I have never been in love before
But since you came in my direction
I've had a change, a change of heart

I never was wanting for a lover
But I never knew what true love was indeed

For the very first time I'm for real
You've got me listening to my heart now

That one will die before he gets there

Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract raps simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
Check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
Hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit

See, my rhymes are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
We'll show you how The Refugees do

Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the laws of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
Rap rejects, my tape deck, ejects projectile
Whether Jew or Gentile, I rank top percentile
Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
My grammar pays like Carlos Santana plays ""Black Magic Woman""
So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in Paris
And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a ""motherfucker"" so you ignant niggas hear me

These cats can't rap, Mr. Author, I feel no vibe
The magazine says the girl should have went solo
The guys should stop rapping, vanish like Menudo
Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start
For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
Do a cameo while everybody do the dance
Quick now, 'cause you running out of luck-a
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munching at your luncheon
I'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the Dutchman
I compress sound sets with my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex
Bring terror to the shop of horror
As she cry, ""mi amor,"" the phantom dies in the opera
And to the youngins who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath (Hold up, hold up)
Violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
Then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet

Ayy, another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, yeah

I'm going from strange to stranger every year
I'm going from strange to stranger every year

I take it back, you're panicking, I take it back
I just don't know
I really thought I wanted to go

But when we're close
You look through me just like a ghost
I like sleeping
I'm only safe when I'm dreaming

I need a new heart
This one's hollow always scheming

You wait for summer
And then you wait for winter
But there's a total lack of splendor

Throw away your crushes
All your childhood crutches away

Never scared of nothing
Violence or loving my way

So withdrawn and feeling numb
Watching life come all undone
Growing fear, a human grace
A drowning mind in a dark embrace
My, life a disarray
And, I fade away

I am down on my knees
Praying beyond belief
The silence deafens my ears
And welds the shackles
Onto my fears
Lost!
All faith!
Lost!
All trust!
Lost!
All faith!
Lost!
All trust!

I have lost all trust

Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family

In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

Some say we'll see Armageddon soon
Certainly hope we will

Fret for your Prozac and fret for your pilot and
